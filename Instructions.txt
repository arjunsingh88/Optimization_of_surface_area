Instruction

1.	Execute the files pro_pso.py to visualize the Particle Swarm Optimization
2.	Execute the files pro_ta.py to visualize the Taboo Search Optimization

visualizations 
-- rectangular plot fit 
-- convergence to max distance over time

the ipynb files contain the code for running th entire script to visualize the 
-- 30 runs of each algorithm(PSO & Taboo Search)
-- Comparison for those 30 runs(PSO V/S Taboo Search)
preferable to execute it with jupyter or google colab

the other two folders contain data obtained during these runs(screenshot of outputs)
